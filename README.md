## Robot Behaviors

### Driving in a Square
**High-Level Description:** This behavior enables the robot to drive in a perfect square path. The approach involves sequential 90-degree turns and straight-line movements equal in length.

**Code Explanation:**
- `drive_straight()`: Commands the robot to move forward a specified distance.
- `turn_right()`: Rotates the robot 90 degrees to the right.

### Wall Follower
**High-Level Description:** The wall follower behavior is designed to keep the robot at a constant distance from a wall. It uses sensors to maintain the distance and navigate along the wall.

**Code Explanation:**
- `follow_wall()`: Continuously adjusts the robot's direction to keep it parallel to the wall.
- `measure_distance()`: Uses sensors to measure the distance from the wall and provides feedback for adjustments.

### Person Follower
**High-Level Description:** This behavior allows the robot to follow a person. It uses visual recognition to identify and track the person's movement.

**Code Explanation:**
- `track_person()`: Identifies and locks onto the person to follow.
- `adjust_path()`: Modifies the robot's path to follow the person while maintaining a safe distance.

## Challenges
In programming these robot behaviors, the main challenges included sensor calibration, ensuring precise movements, and developing robust algorithms for person tracking. Overcoming these required iterative testing and refinement of the code.

## Future Work
With more time, improvements would include enhancing the precision of movements, optimizing the algorithms for faster response times, and integrating machine learning for better person recognition.

## Takeaways
- **Testing and Iteration:** Frequent testing and iteration are crucial for refining robot behaviors. Each test provided insights that guided the next round of improvements.
- **Sensor Reliability:** Ensuring sensor reliability is key to consistent robot performance. This project highlighted the importance of calibrating and maintaining sensors.
